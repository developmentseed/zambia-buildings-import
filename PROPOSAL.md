# Northern Zambia buildings import

*Proposal to import building perimeter outline collected by Akros Global Health to OpenStreetMap*

## Intro

[Akros Global Health](http://akros.com) is an organization that works to strengthen national health systems in developing countries. One of the programs Akros has initiated is [mSpray](http://akros.com/mspray/), Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) for Malaria prevention. IRS is one of the world's best tools in fighting malaria. Insecticides are sprayed on household walls, killing mosquitoes that spread malaria. Stop the mosquito, stop malaria. Funded by the Global Health Bureau at USAID, mSpray is a revolutionary new tool that incorporates three processes to achieve the maximum impact for your IRS dollars. Through this program, Akros collectes data on when to spray, what to spray, and where to spray. Getting these three factors to line up takes lots of planning, and having the best informaiton available increases the effectiveness of a spray campaign.

The main goal of this work is to not only do a large import of buildings (268k records) into Zambia, but set an example for how Akros and other organizations can use field based operations to contribute back to OpenStreetMap. Data was verified by Akros Global Health contributors with assistance from the USAID GeoCenter's Remote Sensing Program. This proposal suggests a one time import, with possible future imports once additional datasets have been cleaned and verified.

There is strong support from various OSM community members: 
  - Dan Bridges, Akros
  - Matt Berg, Ona
  - Chad Blevins, USAID
  - Lauren Jacobson, Development Seed
  - Nate Smith, Development Seed

### Current Status 

Creating the extract for the portion of Zambia where the data is located. Once the extract is created, we will be able to compare the current OSM data to the data to be uploaded.

### License 

All data has been approved by Akros Global Health for import into OpenStreetMap ([Approval file on Github](https://github.com/developmentseed/zambia-buildings-import/blob/master/APPROVAL.md)).

### Import process 
- Create country extract of Zambia to compare the Akros data against
- Create an overlay between the OSM root data and Akros data so as to avoid uploading duplicates
- Once the data has been modified, add the data upload plan to the OSM wiki. As per the wiki: "Write a 'plan' for the data upload on the OSM wiki, as per the wiki: "This plan must include information such as plans for how to convert the data to OSM XML, dividing up the work, how to handle conflation, how to map GIS attributes to OSM tags, how to potentially simplify any data, how you plan to divide up the work, revert plans, changeset size policies, and plans for quality assurance."
- Email the the data imports listserv, and Africa listserv letting them know they can review the upload plan
- Create a designated user account for the upload
- Conduct the upload

#### Dedicated user accounts 

As per OSM import guidelines, this import will be conducted with dedicated user accounts, that pattern for creating user accounts will be as follows: 

    <username>_zambiabuildings

In this project, for the username laurencjay, the account name would be 

    laurencjay_zambiabuildings

#### Conversion Code and Converted Data 

We have created two scripts for this project: 

1. to create the Zambia OSM extract
2. to create the overlay between the Zambia OSM extract, and the Akros dataset. Both of these scripts and our import process documentation can be found on github.

#### Attribute mapping tags 

Tags follow OSM guidelines, currently the only tag being used by this dataset is “building=yes.”

#### Timeline 

- Proposal review August 18th - October 1st 2015
- Incorporate feedback and test imports by October 15th 2015
- Development Seed imports October 19th - October 23rd 2015
- Finalize import by end of October 2015

**Timeline above is rough**
